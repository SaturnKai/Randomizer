Program Instructions:
-----

1. Extract the game's files into a folder.
2. Create a copy of the folder containing the extracted game files. This will serve as a backup.
3. Launch the randomizer tool and click "Select Base Directory".
4. Navigate to the folder we created as a backup and select it.
5. Click "Select Game Directory" and navigate to the other folder we created.
7. Select the aspects on the right that you would like to be randomized.
8. You can enter in a custom seed or click "Regenerate Seed" to generate a new one. If you would like to play the same
randomized settings as someone else, you can simply give them your seed and the randomized aspects will be exactly the same.
9. Click "Randomize". The randomizer will pull from the unmodified Base directory and put it into the Game directory so that
the game will be in a fresh state again before randomizing.
10. Build the game's files from the original directory into a playable image and launch it into an emulator.

Features:
------

The randomizer supports all main releases of the game which include "Kula World", "Roll Away", and "Kula Quest". Almost everything
in the game can be randomized including:

 - All 220 levels in the Arcade gamemode
 - All 10 themes attached to each world
 - All of the sound effects for every object and action
 - All of the object models
